# Customer-Segmentation-in-MachineLearning-using-Python
A model developed to divide customers into segments sharing a similarity in different ways that are relevant to marketing such as gender, age,income etc.
The trends observed from this model are useful for expanding bussiness by targeting the customers.

This project is built using the following:
Machine Learning - KMeans for classifying into clusters
Python
Numpy
Pandas
Scikit Learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn

After forming clusters, appropriate visualization of the clusters is performed in the jupyter notebook
